Now i plan to make this mcp server generalised by exposing the right kind of tools which can be used the VScode github copilot inn agent mode to effectively query the data present in the search index. Now the MCP Server should be disconnected from the details of the documentation processing pipeline. Currently the document processing has only implementation for the work items usecase.
So because initially i had only the work item documentation retrieval idea in mind i had written the code to be specific to work item usecase. Overtime i have migrated the cod eof the document processing pipeline to also support document upload for other use cases .
However the tools exposed by the mcp erver still are only relevant to the wok item usecase . Thus blocking the mcp server to be used for other usecases.

So my main idea is for the mcp server to expose such tools which the LLM of VSCode GitHub copilot agent mode can use to effectively retrieve relevant data from the search index. For this the tools which the mcp server should expose should be such that just with the knowledge of the tools exposed by the mcp server the LLM will be able to know how to fetch the required documents from the search index to answers the users query, and it should also know which documents to drill down into if more detail are asked.

To this end, i have created a markdown file "SIMPLIFIED_MCP_TOOLS_IMPLEMENTATION" wherein i am exploring reducing the number of mcp tools and also making the mcp tools more extensible. For this , as mentioned in the markdown file, i am relying on the core semantic search capability provided by azure cognitive search, this concept acts as the core to reduce the number of mcp tools since if we are able to effectively query all he documents which are relevant to a particular query , then simply querying for the data of the document is very easy we can just query the search index using some unique identified for the relevant documents to get the required documents content.

I want you to read the markdown file and understand what i am trying to achieve and help me compe with a refined set of tools for the mcp server.
Output your plan in a markdown file.
