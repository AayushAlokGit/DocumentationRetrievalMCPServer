Document Chunking Test Script
============================

This script tests the chunking strategies by reading a file and displaying the generated chunks.

Usage:
    python test_file_chunking.py <file_path> [options]

Examples:
    python test_file_chunking.py document.txt
    python test_file_chunking.py document.docx --chunk-size 2000 --overlap 100
    python test_file_chunking.py document.md --strategy simple --show-overlap
